                    <br>
                    I was walking home from work and this couple asked me if I liked cats. The guy had a whole litter of kittens in his sweatshirt pocket, begging for people to give these kittens a good home because they couldn't take care of them. He handed me Mars and I couldn't say no to the little cutie.

                    <br>
                    Mars had a serious case of Single Kitten Syndrome so my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to get him a friend. We went to our local shelter, looked around at several different cats until we saw Saturn (known as Tipper at the shelter) and she started purring like crazy. I knew that we had found our new kitten.
